/*
3	Bank Simulation with Account class (Competence O2)

We want to simulate a bank account and allow the user to pay in money, withdraw money and also check the balance.
Create a class “Account” which has information about the user, currency and balance.
Add methods so you can add money and take money from your account. Include a method which shows how much money you have.

Extension: make the bank interactive
We want the user to interact with the bank. He should be able to use a small menu where he can add amount,
withdraw money within a certain limit, check the balance….
Implement a user-menu which is user-friendly. It should do basic validations and check that the user enters correct data.
Make sure that you work with the correct datatype.

Extension 2: dealing with several accounts
How can we deal with several accounts? Is there a way how we can keep a list of elements?
Try and figure out a solution.
Create a bank class which has an array of accounts. Add a method which allows the user to show all accounts.
The user can also transfer money from one account to another.
